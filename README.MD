# Product Analyst Case Study for Bread

by Kristina Frazier

Welcome to my mini-project submission for the hypothetical A/B test analysis for
Intellicron!

You can find my complete analysis responses in the file "productanalyst_kristinafrazier_2_analysis" (both a Jupyter notebook and .pdf export are included.)

Additionally, the notebook relies on a pre-processed version of the original prequals datasets. The file "productanalyst_kristinafrazier_1_dataprep.py" prepares the data for the production code included in the notebook.

Thank you for reviewing my responses!

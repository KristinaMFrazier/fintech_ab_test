# SCRATCH ANALYSIS STEPS

1. Combine intellicron data with all prequals
    - identify intellicron and non-intellicron records
2. Complete descriptive statistics to analyze the data
    - Confirm record count to ensure succesful merge of data
    - Look at spread of prequal_dates
3. Feature engineering
    - checkout: yes or no
3. What was the impact from implementing Intellicron?
    - Compare the raw approval rates between the two groups
    - Compare the checkout rates between the two groups
4. Perform a hypothesis test to measure the A/B test results. What was the result of the hypothesis test? What is your confidence interval?
    - Follow and replicate the Udacity A/B test project to respond to this
5. Was test and control group assignment done correctly? How can you tell? Is there anything you would do dierently next time?
6. Should we implement Intellicron? What other data, if any, would you need to make this determination?
7. Convert entire code to interactive
    - design as main
    - make interactive to show responses for all 4 questions
